# The full stack, in install order

The workspace guide in this folder gets you the skeleton: one root folder, per-project subfolders, shared memory, and the six skills from this repo. This page is everything else the maintainer runs on top of that, in the order it makes sense to add it, with the one-line installer and the reason each one earns its place.

Versions and commands verified 2026-09-08. Installing a plugin or MCP server takes effect in a **fresh** Claude Code window, not the current one.

## Layer 0: prerequisites

Claude Code, git, and optionally the GitHub CLI. Covered by Step 0 of [README.md](README.md). Nothing here is Claude-specific.

## Layer 1: the workspace pattern and this repo's skills

Covered end to end by [README.md](README.md): the umbrella `CLAUDE.md`, the memory hub and `fanout-memory.sh`, and `/newproject`, `/putdown`, `/pickup`, `/takenotes`, `/skill-dict`, `/grill-me` from `skills/`. Do this first; everything below assumes it.

## Layer 2: recommended for everyone (official plugins, no accounts needed)

These come from Anthropic's plugin marketplace, which Claude Code ships with. If `claude plugin marketplace list` does not show `claude-plugins-official`, add it once:

```
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
```

| Plugin | Install | What it adds | Why it is in the stack |
|---|---|---|---|
| **superpowers** (6.3.0) | `claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official` | Process skills that fire on their own: brainstorming before building, test-driven development, systematic debugging, writing and executing plans, subagent-driven development, verification before claiming done | The single biggest change in how Claude works. It stops the "build first, think later" failure mode by making Claude check for a process skill before every task. Everything in this repo was built under it. |
| **frontend-design** | `claude plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official` | Design guidance when Claude builds or reshapes any UI: typography, palette, layout, avoiding template defaults | Without it, every page Claude makes looks like the same template. With it, pages get deliberate visual choices. Used for every published page in this workspace. |
| **skill-creator** | `claude plugin install skill-creator@claude-plugins-official` | Author, edit, and benchmark your own skills; runs the 20-query trigger-accuracy eval used for the numbers in [eval-results.md](../eval-results.md) | The moment you write your first skill, you need a way to know whether it fires when it should. This is that. |

## Layer 3: optional, with a reason to say no

| Tool | Install | What it adds | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **context-mode** (1.0.169, third-party) | `claude plugin marketplace add mksglu/context-mode` then `claude plugin install context-mode@context-mode` | Runs commands in a sandbox and indexes their output, so large tool results stay out of the conversation and only the derived answer comes back | Real savings on long sessions with big outputs. Also opinionated: it installs hooks that steer Claude toward its own tools, and it occasionally needs a cache repair after plugin updates. Skip it until you have hit the context limit a few times. |
| **Playwright MCP** | `claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --browser chromium --user-data-dir ~/.cache/playwright-mcp-profile` | Lets Claude drive a browser: navigate, click, fill forms, screenshot, read the page | Essential for testing web pages and automating sites without an API. The two flags matter: `--browser chromium` uses Playwright's own bundled browser and `--user-data-dir` gives it its own profile, so automation never touches the Chrome you are logged into. |
| **claude.ai connectors** (Google Drive, Notion, and others) | Enabled in claude.ai under Settings, Connectors; nothing to install locally | Read and search files in Drive, read and write Notion pages, from Claude Code sessions signed into that account | Account-level, so they follow you across machines and into web sessions. They cannot be installed from a repo, which is why they are listed and not scripted. Note that the Drive connector reads documents but cannot write spreadsheet cells. |

## Layer 4: patterns the maintainer uses that you probably should not copy verbatim

Listed so the picture is complete, not as recommendations. None of these ship in this repo.

- **PreToolUse hooks that hard-block a rule.** Memory and `CLAUDE.md` are advisory; Claude can still forget. When a rule has been violated twice, or the word is "never", the maintainer writes a small shell hook in `~/.claude/hooks/` wired into `settings.json` that denies the tool call outright. Example targets: forcing a specific browser for automation, forbidding session files from landing outside their folder. The hooks are personal because the rules are.
- **A CLAUDE.md size reminder.** A hook that prints the current line count whenever Claude edits any `CLAUDE.md`, with the house target. Cheap, and it is why the umbrella template says "under 250 lines".
- **Language servers.** `swift-lsp@claude-plugins-official` exists here for one Swift project. Install a language-server plugin only for languages you actually write.

## After installing anything

Close the Claude Code window and open a new one. Plugins, MCP servers, and skills all register at session start. Then run `/plugin` or `claude plugin list` to confirm what loaded.
