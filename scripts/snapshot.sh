# snapshot.sh — refresh the public repo from local skills with sanitization.
#
# Source of truth: ~/.claude/skills/<name>/  (Charles's local, daily-use copies)
# Target:          this repo's skills/<name>/  (sanitized public snapshot)
#
# This script does NOT copy three skills — each has a parameterized public fork that is
# maintained BY HAND, because the local version encodes setup this repo's users don't have:
#
#   /newproject  — local version hardcodes one workspace layout; public version is parameterized.
#   /takenotes   — local version assumes a canonical shared-memory store with symlinks fanned
#                  into every project, plus a sync script to rebuild them. The public version
#                  treats that as an optional pattern it DETECTS (Step 1c looks for symlinks)
#                  rather than a requirement, so it works on a plain single-project setup.
#   /putdown     — the public version must degrade gracefully when /takenotes is absent
#                  ("if installed, invoke it; otherwise do this inline"). The local version
#                  invokes it unconditionally, because locally it is always installed.
#                  Auto-copying would silently delete that fallback and break standalone installs.
#
# These three are still SANITIZED and residue-checked below (sanitization is idempotent, so
# running it over an already-clean hand-maintained file is a harmless no-op) — they are just
# never overwritten from ~/.claude/skills/.
#
# Run from anywhere; resolves its own location.

# --- 4. Guard against sanitization residue ---
# The sed rules above convert "Charles" / "Charles's" → "you" / "your", which only
# reads correctly when the source uses possessives or second person. A source line
# written in third-person subject form (e.g. "Charles maintains ... he's installed")
# sanitizes to broken text ("you maintains ... he's installed"): sed can't fix verb
# agreement, and bare pronouns (he/his/him/he's) referring to the maintainer aren't
# caught by the name rules. Those pronouns almost always travel with such drift, so
# fail loudly on a leaked name or pronoun — drift gets fixed at the source, never
# shipped silently. (The content has no legitimate third-person pronouns; if a future
# skill needs one referring to someone else, narrow this check then.)
